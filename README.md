  * A user can create one or more lists that will eventually contain multiple items, each with a description and a quantity
  ```

  I want to create a list
  So that I can have a logical collection of household items
  ```
  
  * A user can create one or more items that are associated with each list
  ```
  As a user
  I want to create items
  So that I can know how many of each item I have and add those items to a list
  ```
  
##Week 2 - 4/18/14

* Add the functionality to allow for the generation of shopping lists based on data in their lists.
  * A user can click 'Generate Shopping List' to generate a list based on a selected threshold.

  I want to generate a shopping list
  So that I can know what items I am low on
  ```
  
  * A user can edit the quantity of items in lists
  ```
  As a user

  So that I can update how many of them I have

##Week 3 - 5/2/14

* Add the functionality to increment and decrement an item in a list with the push of a button as well ass add additional notifications.
  * A user can click increment or decrement on an item to increase or decrease the quantity of that item by 1.
  ```

  I want to quickly change the quantity of an item in my list
  So that I don't have to enter the edit page
  ```
  
  * A user receives notifications on the home page to warn them about potentially low items in their lists.
  ```
  As a user
  I want to receive a notification
  So that I am aware when I am low on items
  ```
